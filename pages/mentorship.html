                <h2>Mentorship</h2>
                <p style="color: white;">Mentorship is a huge part of my life. From creating <a href="https://www.newwaves.org/" target=”_blank”> New Waves</a>, a fitness program for youth created durring the rise of covid, coaching different youth basketball teams, volunteering as a mentor for <a href="https://www.tawasaw.org/"target=”_blank”> Tawasaw</a> (a bay area based religious non-profit organization), and being hired as a mentor at <a href="https://averroeshighschool.com/" target=”_blank” > Averroes</a> my old highschool. I have passion in trying to benifit the people around me and creating a positive environment where people can grow.</p>

                    <h1>New Waves</h1>
                    <p>New Waves was a project I started durring covid because I saw that there was starting to become a problem with kids health due to school PE being out of session and there were not many programs to get them active due to covid. This is when I decided to make my own mentorship/bootcamp program called New Waves which was outdoor and covid friendly. It was a huge sucsess and people kept on coming back for more. One specific student was 1 blood sugar point away from diebeties and above a healthy body weight. In 6 months he was not only far from diebetic, but went from not being close to being able to do a single pushup to being able to do 15-20 in one set! </p>
