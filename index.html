            Mentorship
        </h2>
        <p>
            Mentorship is a huge part of my life. From creating my own fitness program for youth durring covid, coaching different <br>youth basketball teams, volunteering as a mentor for Tawasaw (a bay area based religious non-profit organization),<br> and being hired as a mentor at Averroes my old highschool. I have passion in trying to benifit the people around me and <br>creating a positive environment where people can grow.
