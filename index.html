                    <p style="color: antiquewhite;"><br>I am a Muslim Palestinian/American born and raised in America. My passions in life are to create spaces of healthy community and growth. I believe that the way to this is through communal effort, mentorship, patience, and the highest regard for truth. I believe that this applies to the working environment as well which is why it has taken up a good portion of my website. I wish to use my skills as a programmer to further to improve my company and the society I live in.
